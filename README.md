# Deadeye (Archived)

> **This repo has been archived.** Development continues in the [baseball-games monorepo](https://github.com/coherency1/baseball-games) under `games/deadeye/`.

Daily baseball darts. Given a target score and stat category, guess MLB player seasons to count down to exactly zero.

**Live at:** [coherency.lol/baseball/deadeye](https://coherency.lol/baseball/deadeye/)

**Built with**: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
**Data**: [Lahman Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/)

## Gameplay

Each day a new challenge is revealed:

> **1998 MLB · Home Runs — Target: 290**

You search for player seasons from that year. Each dart you throw subtracts that player's stat from your running total. Goal: reach exactly 0 (or as close as possible).

- **Bullseye 🎯** — exact 0
- **Bust 💥** — went negative (Hard mode only: game over)
- **Stand** — lock in your score at any time

### Dart quality
| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🎯 | Bullseye — exactly 0 remaining |
| 🟢 | Great — reduced score by >50% |
| 🟡 | Good — reduced score by 25–50% |
| 🔴 | Small — reduced by <25% |

### Game modes
- **Easy**: Going negative is allowed; distance from 0 is your final score
- **Hard**: Going negative = bust, game over

## Daily Challenges

Challenges are seeded by the current date using `seedrandom` — everyone gets the same puzzle each day. The target is the sum of the top 5 player-seasons for that year/stat combination.

**Stat categories**: HR, RBI, H, SB, BB, R, XBH (batting) · W, SV, K (pitching)

**Restrictions** (rotate every few days):
- All-Star seasons only
- Hall of Famers only

## Roadmap

- [ ] NBA support (Phase 2 — via BALLDONTLIE API with server-side cache)
- [ ] Global leaderboard (Supabase)
- [ ] Streak tracking
- [ ] Literal dartboard UI variant
- [ ] Historical challenge archive
